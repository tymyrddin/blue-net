# Network security monitoring

Network monitoring is a set of management actions to watch/continuously overview and optionally save the network traffic for further investigation. This action aims to detect and reduce network problems, improve performance, and in some cases, increase overall productivity. It is a main part of the daily IT/SOC operations and differs from Network Security Monitoring (NSM) in its purpose.

## Network monitoring

Network monitoring is highly focused on IT assets like uptime (availability), device health and connection quality 
(performance), and network traffic balance and management (configuration). Monitoring and visualising the network 
traffic, troubleshooting, and root cause analysis are also part of the Network Monitoring process. 

This model is helpful for network administrators and usually doesn't cover identifying non-asset in-depth 
vulnerabilities and significant security concerns like internal threats and zero-day vulnerabilities. Usually, 
Network Monitoring is not within the SOC scope. It is linked to the enterprise IT/Network management team.

## Network security monitoring

Network Security Monitoring is focused on network anomalies like rogue hosts, encrypted traffic, suspicious service 
and port usage, and malicious/suspicious traffic patterns in an intrusion/anomaly detection and response approach. 
Monitoring and visualising the network traffic and investigating suspicious events is a core part of Network 
Security Monitoring. 

This model is helpful for security analysts/incident responders, security engineers and threat hunters and covers 
identifying threats, vulnerabilities and security issues with a set of rules, signatures and patterns. Network 
Security Monitoring is part of the SOC, and the actions are separated between tier 1-2-3 analyst levels.
