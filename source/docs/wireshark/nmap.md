# Nmap scans

Nmap is an industry-standard tool for mapping networks, identifying live hosts and discovering the services. As it is one of the most used network scanner tools, a security analyst should identify the network patterns created with it. This section will cover identifying the most common Nmap scan types.

* TCP connect scans
* SYN scans
* UDP scans

It is essential to know how Nmap scans work to spot scan activity on the network.
