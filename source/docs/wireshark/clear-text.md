# Clear-text protocol analysis

Investigating clear-text protocol traces sounds easy, but when the time comes to investigate a big network trace for 
incident analysis and response, the game changes. Proper analysis is more than following the stream and reading the 
cleartext data. For a security analyst, it is important to create statistics and key results from the investigation 
process. 

## FTP analysis

File Transfer Protocol (FTP) is designed to transfer files with ease, so it focuses on simplicity rather than security. 
As a result of this, using this protocol in unsecured environments could create security issues like:

* On-path attacks
* Credential stealing and unauthorised access
* Phishing
* Malware planting
* Data exfiltration

## HTTP Analysis

Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is a clear-text-based, request-response and client-server protocol. It is the 
standard type of network activity to request/serve web pages, and by default, it is not blocked by any network 
perimeter. As a result of being unencrypted and the backbone of web traffic, HTTP is one of the must-to-know 
protocols in traffic analysis. Following attacks could be detected with the help of HTTP analysis:

* Phishing pages
* Web attacks
* Data exfiltration
* Command and control traffic (C2)

## User-Agent analysis

As the adversaries use sophisticated technics to accomplish attacks, they try to leave traces similar to natural 
traffic through the known and trusted protocols. For a security analyst, it is important to spot the anomaly signs 
on the bits and pieces of the packets. The `user-agent` field is one of the great resources for spotting anomalies 
in HTTP traffic. In some cases, adversaries successfully modify the `user-agent` data, which could look supernatural. 
A security analyst cannot rely only on the `user-agent` field to spot an anomaly. Never whitelist a `user-agent`, even 
if it looks natural. User-agent-based anomaly/threat detection/hunting is an additional data source to check and 
is useful when there is an obvious anomaly.
